# Nasa-Knowledge-Graph
This project explores and visualizes a Knowledge Graph built from NASA datasets. It demonstrates how entities like missions, spacecraft, instruments, and celestial bodies can be represented and connected through relationships using graph-based data structures.

Objectives

Construct a knowledge graph from NASA open data sources.

Model relationships between scientific missions, instruments, and observations.

Enable querying and visualization of complex interconnections in space research data.

Features

Data ingestion and preprocessing from NASA APIs or CSV datasets.

Graph creation using Python libraries (e.g., networkx, rdflib, or pyvis).

Interactive visualization of entities and their relationships.

Query examples for exploring specific connections (e.g., mission → instrument → celestial body).

Technologies Used

Python

NetworkX / PyVis for graph construction and visualization

Pandas / NumPy for data processing

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and demonstration
